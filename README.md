# Mini Project 7 : Package a Rust Script into a Command-Line Tool
## Katelyn Hucker (kh509) [![Clippy](https://github.com/nogibjj/kh509_miniproject7/actions/workflows/clippy.yml/badge.svg)]
This is my mini project which is an introduction to coding in Rust. My project is a command line tool, which adds and removes fruits to a fruit list, which is already created. The original project can be found on [here](https://github.com/nogibjj/rust-data-engineering/blob/main/calc-cli-with-tests/src/lib.rs). Instead of randomly getting fruits, my project lets users interact by adding and removing so it is now has more functionality.
